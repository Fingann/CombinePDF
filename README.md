# CombinePDF

I made this tool because i needed to combine PDFs. All the tools i could find either had restrictions on how many pages or pdfs you could combine or cost money. 

This tool is easy and straight forward to use. 

Drag and Drop the PDFs you want to combine. Choose the order you want the pdfs to combine in. Finaly click combine to create your PDF.
